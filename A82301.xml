         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A ſhrub may grow neer unto a Cedar; High and low, great and ſmall, The rich and poor meet together: The Lord is the maker of them all.

And the Lord ſmote the King, ſo that hee was a Leaper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a ſeverall houſe, and <hi>Jothan</hi> the Kings ſon was over the houſe, judging the people of the Land. And King
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, according to all that <hi>David</hi> his Father did. He removed the high places, and brake the Images, and cut down the Groves, &amp;c. he truſted in the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo that after him there was none like him among all the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> nor any that went before him. For he clave to the Lord, and departed not from following him; but kept his Comandements which the Lord comanded <hi>Moſes.</hi> And the Lord was with him, and he proſpered whither ſoever he went forth: and he rebelled againſt the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and ſerved him not. And King
<hi>Joſiah</hi> did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, and walked in all the wayes of <hi>David</hi> his Father, and turned not aſide to the right hand or to the left. And the King ſent, and they gathered unto him all the Elders of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> and of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the King went up into the houſe of the Lord, and all the men of <hi>Judah,</hi> and all the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with them, and the Prieſts, and the Prophets, and all the people both ſmall and great: and he read in their ears <pb facs="tcp:117311:5"/> all the words of the book of the Covenant which was found in the houſe of the Lord. And the King ſtood by a pillar, and made a Covenant before the Lord, to walke before the Lord, and to keep his Comandments, and his Teſtimonies, and his Statutes, with all their heart, and all their ſoule, to perform the words of this Covenant, that were written in this book: and all the people ſtood to the Covenant. And the King comanded all the veſſels that were made for <hi>Baal,</hi> and for the Grove, and for the Hoaſt of heaven, to be brought forth out of the Temple of the Lord, and he burnt them without <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the fields of <hi>Kidron,</hi> and carryed the Aſhes of them unto <hi>Bethel.</hi> And he put down the Idolatrous Prieſts, whom the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> had ordained to burn incenſe in the high places, &amp;c. Moreover, the workers with familiar Spirits, and the Wizards, and the Images and the Idols, and all the abominations that were ſpyed in the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> and in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> did <hi>Joſiah</hi> put away, that he might performe the words of the Law which were written in the Book that <hi>Hilkiah</hi> the Prieſt found in the Houſe of the Lord. And like unto him was there no King before him, that turned to the Lord with all his heart and with all his ſoule, and with all his might, according to all the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> neither after him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe any like him: 2

            <p>Now, therefore, my Lord the King ariſe, and be doing, and the Lord be with thee. And command all your Children, your Confederates and Allies, your Nobles and your Commons, and all the people of your Kingdoms to help you, ſaying, <hi>Is not the Lord your God with you? And hath he not given you reſt on every ſide? for he hath given your enemies into your hands, and the Land is ſubdued before the Lord, and before his people.</hi> Now ſet your heart and your ſoul to ſeeke the Lord your God: ariſe therefore, and build ye the Sanctuary of the Lord God, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Religion in its purity according to Gods Word: ſettle the Church government, compoſe the differences, and heal the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers <pb facs="tcp:117311:6"/> that our ſins have made, repair ye the breaches, and build up the waſte places in the Church and State, and doe you Judgement and Juſtice throughout all my Dominions. And comand all the people to gather themſelves together as one man, and to make confeſſion ſaying. <hi>O Lord the great and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God, keeping the Covenant, and mercie to them that love him, and to them that keepe his Comandements.</hi> We have ſinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled, even hy departing from thy precepts and from thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Neither have we harkned unto thy ſervants, the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Preachers of thy Word and Ordinances, which ſpake in thy name, to our King, our Princes, and our Fathers, and to all the people of the Land. O Lord, to us belongeth confuſion of face, becauſe we have ſinned againſt thee. To the Lord our God belongeth mercies, and forgiveneſſes, though we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt him. O Lord, we have been diſobedient and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt thee, and caſt thy Law behinde our backs, &amp; have ſlain thy ſervants which teſtified againſt us to turn us unto thee, and we have wrought great provocations: therefore thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereſt us into the hands of our enemies, who vexed us, &amp; in the time of our trouble, when we cryed unto thee, thou heardſt us from heaven: and according to thy manifold mercies thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt us Saviours, who ſaved us out of the hands of our enemies. But after we had reſt, we did evill again before thee, therefore lefteſt thou us in the hand of our enemies, ſo that they had the dominion over us, yet when we returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardſt us from heaven, and many times didſt thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us, according to thy mercies. Thou didſt not utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume us nor forſake us; for thou art a gracious and a mercifull God. Now therefore our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepeſt Covenant and mercie: Let not all the trouble ſeeme little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our King, on our Princes and Nobles, and on our Miniſters <pb facs="tcp:117311:6"/> and Elders, &amp; on our fathers, &amp; on all thy people; ſince the time of the Kings departing from his Parliaments, and people unto this day. Howbeit, thou art juſt in all that is brought upon us, for thou haſt done right, but we have done wickedly. Neither have, our King, our Princes and Nobles, our Elders and Miniſters of thy Word, nor our Fathers kept thy Law: nor hearkned unto thy Commandements, and thy Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, wherewith thou didſt teſtifie againſt them. For they have not ſerved thee in their Kingdom, &amp; in thy great goodneſs that thou gaveſt them; and in the large and fatland which thou gaveſt before them, neither turned they from their wicked works. Behold, we are ſervants this day; and for the land which thou gaveſt unto our Fathers, to eat the fruit thereof, and the good thereof, behold we are ſervants in it. And it yieldeth much increaſe unto them, whom thou haſt ſet over us, becauſe of our ſins: alſo they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell at their pleaſure; and we are in great diſtreſs. And becauſe of all this, let us make a ſure Covenant, and write it; and let the King, our Princes and Nobles, our Elders and Miniſters of Gods Word and Ordinances, our Fathers, and all the people of your Majeſties Dominions ſeal unto it. And finally, may it pleaſe your Excellent Majeſty, to attend unto the doctrine and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Apoſtle. 1 <hi>Theſ. Chap.</hi> 5. and <hi>Hebrews</hi> 13.20, 21.

And this man becauſe he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable Prieſthood. Wherefore he is able alſo to ſave them to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them. Moſes verily was faithfull in all his houſe, as a ſervant, for a teſtimony of thoſe things which were to be ſpoken after, but Chriſt as a Sonne over his owne houſe, whoſe houſe are we, if we hold faſt the confidence, and the rejoycing of the hope firme unto the end. Let us not be ſlothfull, but followers of them who through faith and patience, inherit the promiſes. For God is not unrighteous to forget the work and labour of love which his ſervants have ſhewed towards his Name. The earth which drinketh in the raine that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth herbs meet for them, for whom it is dreſſed, receiveth bleſſing from God. But that which beareth thornes and briars, is rejected, and is nigh unto curſing, whoſe and is to be burned.

Elſe if we do in any wiſe go back, and cleave unto the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Idolatry that remaineth among us. Know for a certainty, that the Lord our God will no more be mercifull unto us; will no more be among us, and deliver us: But thoſe Idol-worſhippers, falſe, bloudy-hearted Papiſts, ſhall be ſnares and traps unto us, and ſcourges in our ſides, and thornes <pb n="3" facs="tcp:117311:8"/> in our eyes, untill we are reſtrained from all the good things which the Lord our God hath given us.

               <p>The toleration of Maſſing Religion, is againſt the grounds of true Chriſtian Religion, againſt reaſon, and againſt the policy of the Common-wealth; as I finde at large in an Anſwer to the Maſſe-Prieſts preſumptuous Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion directed to our late King
<hi>James,</hi> of renowned memory, and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 1604. Our Adverſaries themſelves declare, that indifferency of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or toleration of two contrary Religions in one Kingdome, is intolerable, <hi>Poſſevin. Biblioth. Select. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 26. ſaith, 1 It is a diveliſh invention: 2 that it is contrary to Gods Ordinance: 3 that it repugneth againſt the Lawes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of nature, and the Goſpell it ſelfe. 4 That it is contrary to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and proprieties of Chriſtian faith: 5 That it taketh away the truth and certainty of Chriſtian faith: 6 That it taketh away the certainty of Gods divine Worſhip, and of the Church: 7 That it taketh away Chriſtian Diſcipline: 8 That it cutteth aſunder the unity of the Church: 9 That it is contrary to the Word of God. 10 That it is repugnant to the practiſe of the Primitive Church, the authority of Fathers, and Decrees of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours: And finally, that it provokrth the wrath of God againſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of it. If then the Adverſaries themſelves ſee Liberty of divers Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be ſo pernicious, where they have winde in pupp; I hope they will pardon others that will not admit their lewd, pernicious, and phantaſticall opinions. We read in our Hiſtories; when <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> ſon of <hi>Albert,</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> about the year, 1440. went to <hi>Bohemia,</hi> there to be crowned, (where <hi>Pogtebracius</hi> had the Governance,) that during all the time of his <pb n="4" facs="tcp:117311:9"/> being there, though being much requeſted, yet would the young King nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enter into the Churches; nor hear the ſervice of them, which did draw after the Doctrine of
<hi>Hus.</hi> Alſo before he departed thence, he thought firſt to viſit the noble City of <hi>Uratiſlavia</hi> in <hi>Schleſia.</hi> In the which City the aforeſaid King <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> being there in the high Church at Service, many great Princes were about him, among whom was alſo <hi>George Pogiebracius,</hi> who then ſtood neereſt to the King; unto whom one
<hi>Chilianus</hi> playing the Paraſite about the King, (as the faſhion is of ſuch as feign themſelves fooles, to make other men as very fooles as they) ſpake in this wiſe, as followeth: <hi>With what countenance you do behold this our Service, I ſee right well, but your heart I do not ſee.</hi> Say then, doth not the Order of this our Religion ſeem unto you decent, and comely? Do you not ſee how many, and how great Princes, yea, the King himſelf, do follow one Order and Uniformity? And why do you rather follow your Preacher <hi>Rochezana,</hi> than theſe? Do you think a few
<hi>Bohemians</hi> to be more wiſe, then all the Church of Chriſt beſides? Why then do you not forſake that rude and ruſticall people, and joyne to theſe Nobles, as you are a Noble man your ſelfe? Unto whom thus
<hi>Pogiebracius</hi> ſagely again doth anſwer. <hi>If you ſpeak theſe words of your ſelf, ſaith he, you are not the man, whom you faine your ſelf to be, and ſo to you I anſwer, as not to a foole; but if you ſpeak this by ſuggeſtion of others, then muſt I ſatisfie them.</hi> Here therefore, as touching the Ceremonies of the Church, every man hath a conſcience of his own to follow. As for us, we neither uſe ſuch Ceremonies, as we truſt do pleaſe God: neither is it in our arbitrement, to believe what we will our ſelves. The minde of man being perſwaded with great reaſons, is captivated, will he, nill he; and as nature is inſtructed and taught, ſo is ſhe drawn, in ſome one way, and in ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As for my ſelfe, I am fully perſwaded in the Religion of my Preachers. If I ſhould follow thy Religion, I might perchance deceive men, going contrary to mine own Conſcience; but I cannot deceive God, who ſeeth the hearts of all: neither ſhall it become me, to frame my ſelfe like to thy diſpoſition. That which is meet for a Jeſter, is not likewiſe convenient for a Noble man. And theſe words, either take to thy ſelf, as ſpoken to thee, if thou be a wiſe man: or elſe I refer them to thoſe which ſet thee a work.</p>
               <p>To this learned and diſcreet anſwer of

A true ſaving faith, only (I ſay) can diſtinctly and perfectly ſee that life of the Soule, which is hid with Chriſt in God, which the blear eye of ſence, or reaſon, can in no wiſe diſcover, or diſcerne. There is but one true Religion, Man ha's but one way to walke in. Howbeit, there are many by-paths, &amp;c. and thoſe too, inſcrutable. In the large Maze of Religions profeſſed in
<hi>Amſterdam;</hi> (I had almoſt ſaid <hi>London.</hi>) Surely, the ſhort threed of mans life will ſcarce clew him through the ſeverall Conclaves of them all; and ſo guide him to the right. Variety unhindges the door of the heart, and for eagerneſſe of giving more ſpeedy entrance to all in-commers; it blocks up the paſſage, and diſpels the timely motions of the ſpirit; and the ſeeds of of ſanctity, that would root and ſettle themſelves in the ſoule. In this neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated coarctation, whether ſhall fickle man betake himſelfe? The choiſe of Religion is of ſome conſequence, and moment, not inſtantly to be reſolved upon by the beſt judgement. This ſtumbles a man of riper years. There is an awing ſuperiour, and a ſovereigne Diety, that ſcepters the hearts of men. Religion carries a confutation along with it, and tongue-ties inquiſitive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Propound many things we may, and revolve with our thoughts a while; uncouth conceits may ſtartle us, and unſettle the affections of the minde: and yet when we have done all we can in thinking, the beſt of us ſit down aſtoniſhed; and as men hurried in a Wilderneſſe, our Pilgrime-ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations amazedly gaze after we know not what. And 'tis well, if we can ſubſide to an holy Admiration. If with reverence, we proſtrate our ſelves, certainly the Spirit will erect us; direct our ſteps, and guide us in the way everlaſting. What our reaſon cannot reach, let the hand of faith apprehend. Where the depth of our judgements may not fathom, let us truſt the mercy of the waves ſupporting us; leſt we merge our ſelves in deſpaire. Where God commands, do we muſt. And therefore ſince we are all made for the ſervice of God Almighty, the Maker of all things; let us walk in all holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of converſation, during this our Pilgrimage here upon earth: ſo ſhall we finde reſt unto our ſoules, in the Haven of Felicity. 'Tis true, Happineſſe is the Scope, whereunto naturally all men do levell their thoughts: but it is the juſt man that attaines the end of his deſires; that ha's the fruition of <pb n="6" facs="tcp:117311:10"/> his hopes: his beſt intentions onely arrow the white. <hi>Unâ omnes voco,</hi> all of us in the <hi>Optative Mood</hi> can ſay; Faine would we be in that Paradiſe of Joy, and place of Bliſſe, where <hi>Crownes</hi> and <hi>Palmes</hi> are given.

               <p>Now as touching the Grand Caſe of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> which hath exerciſed ſo many wits this Parliament, I ſhall give my opinion, thus; I have been reſolved, and ſetled in my judgement of a long time; that the <hi>Supereminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Prerogatives, Temporall Dignities, Barronies,</hi> intermedling in Secular Affaires, and the Lordly <hi>Monopolizing</hi> of Titles, Juriſdictions, and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, by <hi>Archbiſhops,</hi> and
<hi>Biſhops</hi> above the Paſtors and Teachers of Gods Word, their fellow-latourers; and that the High-Commiſſion, with the whole Regiment of it's ſubordinary Offices; likewiſe <hi>Deaneries,</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117311:10"/> 
                  <hi>Chapters,</hi> with their dependencies, are all contrary to Gods Word, unlawfull, &amp; unwarrantable in themſelves, pernicious, &amp; deſtructive of the peace &amp; godly unanimity, which ought to be in a true Chriſtian Church, and Common-wealth. But, I confeſſe, the many learned Books, and Writings, which I have ſeen, and diligently peruſed, ſince this queſtion hath been moved, and throughly debated of late by many ſage, acute Doctors, and other learned men of divers Nations, and Kingdomes, have not only much confirmed; but inſtructed me alſo in this point. 'Tis true, that <hi>ex gratiá Regis,</hi> by the favour of the Prince, and for Government ſake, the Order of <hi>Biſhops</hi> hath ſtood a long time in our Nation, ſupported by the Lawes of the Realme; and confirmed by Parliaments: And ſo I ſee no reaſon, why by the ſame legiſlative Power it may not be altered.

<hi>Religious, painfull, and learned Preacher may be placed with a Competent Livelyhood, and Maintenance; for the faithfull and true diſcharge of their Calling.</hi> I ſhall forbear to inſiſt upon this matter, or to preſſe it as large; for that Mr. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> that worthy, and laborious Miniſter of Gods Word (by whoſe preaching and exhortations, thouſands of ſouls have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted much, and as I may probably ſay, many have been converted) hath faſtned upon this Subject already; as I finde in a learned Sermon of his preached before the Honourable Houſe of Commons,

But I proteſt in the truth of my heart, were I of riper years, had I been bleſſed with a convenable eſtate, and fortune; had I been of judgement, or had the honour and abilities, to have ſupplied a roome, as the meaneſt Member of that Noble, and great Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; in all humility, by a diſcreet obſerving of the Countenance and Order of that Court; I would have uſed my beſt endeavours for the promoting and furtherance of this Motion: and I would have laboured, and aſſayed all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt wayes, and direct courſes in this weighty, and only ſpeciall affaire, for the ſecurity and happineſſe both of Church, and State; had I ſeen any hopes

               <p>NOw to this diſcourſe of Religion, I will onely adde a line, or two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> which I have undertaken for my profeſſion and calling: And (by Gods aſſiſtance) I ſhall propoſe this, as the main end in all my ſtudies and endevours, the honour of God, the ſervice of my Prince, the profit of my Country, and the good of the Church. <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath been inhabited always <hi>with a vertuous and wiſe people,</hi> who ever embraced honeſt and good cuſtomes, full of reaſon and conveniency, which being confirm'd by common uſe and practiſe, and continued time out of mind, became the Common Law of the Land. And though this Law be the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar invention of this Nation; and delivered over from age to age by Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as well as by Books) yet may we truly ſay, That no humane Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or unwritten hath more certainty in the Rules or Maximes, more cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the parts thereof, or more harmony of reaſon in it: nay, we confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently aver, that it doth excell all other Laws in upholding of a free Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, which is the moſt excellent form of Government, exalting the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Royall, and being very tender and watchfull to preſerve it; and yet maintaining with all the ingenuous liberty of the ſubject. Moreover, all men, at all times, and in all places doe ſtand in need of Juſtice, and of Law which is the rule of Juſtice, and of the Interpreters and Miniſters of the Law, which give life and motion unto Juſtice; for <hi>Caſſaneus</hi> well obſerveth, that, <hi>Juſtitia periret, ſi deeſſet qui juſtitiam allegaret.</hi> Our Counſellors and Advocates are the language of the Law: Our Judges are the eare of the Law.

Thoſe Honourable perſons, whoſe true minde hath advanced them to the moſt tranſcendent places of honour, that can poſſibly be attained in our profeſſion, that is, to be Hearers, Judges and Determiners of cauſes, in Courts of Juſtice: let them take heed diligently unto themſelves, that no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour nor whatſoever reſpects move them from the right. And let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that they ſit not in judgement for rewarding of friends or ſervants, for croſſing of contemners, but only for doing of Juſtice. <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Pol.

<hi>Sanctio ſancta, jubens honeſta, &amp; prohibens contraria.</hi> Again, the Law is nothing elſe, but a rule or leſſon of juſtice, that is made to meaſure the actions of men. And how needfull is the ſervice of upright, ſage and learned men in the Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which juſtice it ſelf cannot poſſibly ſtand? Therefore though <hi>Jupiter</hi> (as <hi>Protagoras</hi> in <hi>Plato</hi> telleth us) did firſt invent, and give the Law, yet was
<hi>Mercury</hi> ſent with that heavenly gift, to deliver it ever unto mankinde. So as it is manifeſt, that without the Miniſtry of theſe
<hi>Mercuries,</hi> of theſe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the Law, namely, the learned Profeſſors thereof; there can be no uſe, or application of the Law, and conſequently the Law, or Iuſtice it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt without them. What a meritorious work is it, to reſolve thoſe many troubleſome queſtions which ariſe in the civill life of man, either by laying open the truth of the fact, or by cleering the doubtfull point in Law, that ſpeedy and equall juſtice may be done unto all, and every one may have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117311:15"/> and enjoy his own in peace? How often would the truth be concealed, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed? How oft would fraud lie hid, and undiſcovered? How many times would wrong eſcape, and paſſe unpuniſhed, but for the wiſdom and diligence of the Profeſſors of the Law? Doth not this Profeſſion every day comfort ſuch as are grieved, prevent the ruine of the improvident, ſave the innocent, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the impotent, take the prey out of the mouth of the oppreſſor, protect the Orphan, the Widow, and the Stranger? Is ſhe not <hi>Oculus coeco, &amp; pes claudo,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh? Doth ſhee not with all many times ſtretch forth <hi>Brachium Seculare,</hi> in defence of the Church, and true Religion? All which are workes of mercy, and ſingular merit. Againe, doth ſhee not Regiſter, and keepe in memories the beſt Antiquities of our Nation? Doth ſhe not preſerve our ancient cuſtomes and formes of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, wherein the wiſedom of our Anceſtors doth ſhine far above the policy of other Kingdomes. Why may we not then affirme confidently, and conclude that the profeſſion of the Law, is to be preferred before all other humane profeſſions and Sciences, as being moſt neceſſary for the Common and continuall uſe thereof? For doe not all perſons, at all times, and in all places ſtand in need of juſtice. When without her rule,
<hi>The Prince himſelfe knows not how to rule, nor his people how to obey?</hi> When we can neither travel ſafely by day, nor ſleep ſecurely by night without her protection? For we cannot without peril make a Voyage by ſea, unleſſe ſhe waft us; nor a journey by land unleſſe ſhe convoy us. We ſhould be oppreſt by force in the Countrey, if ſhe did not defend us; And undone by fraud in the City. if ſhe did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us. She incloſeth every mans garden and field, and makes every mans Cotage his Caſtle of defence. So as we have not ſuch an univerſall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall uſe, neither of the light of the Sun nor of fire and water; as we have of the light and heat, and comfort of juſtice: For a man may remaine alive ſome houres, without the uſe of thoſe common benefits; but a Common-wealth, wherein each private mans weal conſiſteth, cannot ſtand and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue one minute of an houre, if juſtice which is her ſoule be departed from her. And, again, is not the Profeſſion of the Law moſt meritorious for the good effects it doth produce in the Common-wealth? For doth not all out peace, plenty, civility, and morall honeſty depend upon the Law. <hi>Quid ſunt regna niſi latrocinia ſine juſtitia?</hi> Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> faith, Without juſtice, the Land would be full of Thieves: the Sea full of Pirats. And I may adde; The Commons would riſe againſt the Nobility, the Nobility againſt the Crown: we ſhould not know what were our own, what another mans, what <pb n="17" facs="tcp:117311:15"/> we ſhould have from our Anceſtors, what we ſhould leave to our children: <hi>Major haereditas venit uni cuique noſtrum à jure &amp; legibus, quàm à parenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cicero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, there would be nothing certaine, nothing ſure, no contracts, no commerce, no converſation among men; but all Kingdomes and States would be brought to confuſion: and all humane ſociety would be diſſolved. And laſtly, is not the profeſſion of the law moſt noble, for the matter and ſubject thereof? For what is the matter and ſubject of our Profeſſion, but Juſtice, the Lady, and Queen of all morall vertues? And what are our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Law, but her Counſellours, her Secretaries, her Interpreters, her Servants? Againe, <hi>What is the King himſelf, but the cleare Fountain of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice?</hi> and what are the profeſſors of the law, but conduit pipes deriving, and covering the ſtreames of his Juſtice unto all the Subj cts of his ſeverall Kingdomes? So as if Juſtice be rightly reſembled to the Sun in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that ſhe ſpreadeth her light and vertue unto all creatures: How can ſhe but communicate part of her goodneſſe and glory, unto that Science, that is her handmaid, and waits upon her? And for as much as <hi>Kings be Gods Schollers,</hi> (as <hi>Homer</hi> writeth) and that the rules of juſtice, be their principall leſſon; and we read in the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> of that Kingly Prophet <hi>David,</hi> that God doth honour Kings and Magiſtrates with his own Name; <hi>Dixi quod düestis; Pſal.</hi> 82. Specially for that they <hi>ſit upon Gods own Seat, when they miniſter juſtice unto the people.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.3. <hi>The Lord is a great God, and a great King above all Gods:</hi> that is, above Angels, Princes, or falſe Gods. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 8.6. and 82.6. and 96.4 5. And whereas we read, that Kings ſhall be the nurſing fathers, and Queens ſhall be the nurſing mothers of the Church, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40. And we be taught by the holy Scriptures, that the hearts of Kings are in the rule and governance of Almighty God. <hi>Let us pray pray therefore for Kings, and for all that are in authority,</hi> that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life in all godlineſſe, and honeſty. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 22. <hi>And let all loyal Subjects, and faithful ſervants of our Sovereigne Lord King</hi> Charles,

He ſhall judge thy people with righteouſneſſe, and the poore with judgement.</hi> We know by the Maximes, and Rules of the Common Law, that <hi>Rex eſt caput &amp; ſalus reipublicae &amp; à capite bona valetudo tranſit in omnes: The King is the head, the life and health of the Common-wealth;</hi> and from the head this ſpirit and vivacity of health is tranſmitted and conveyed into the ſeveral parts and <pb n="18" facs="tcp:117311:16"/> members of the body. And againe (we ſay) that, the King can doe no wrong. <hi>Rex enim verè dici potuit, vbique transferre, &amp; perpetuò ſecum por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare Scaccarium Juſtitiae in ſcrinio pectoris ſui; Atque veram intelligentiam perfectamque legis notitiam in animo ſuo ſemper habere.</hi> For the King may truely be ſaid every where to transfer, and alwayes to carry about with him the Exchequer or Treaſury of Iuſtice in the casket of his breaſt; And ever to have the true underſtanding &amp; perfect Theorie, or knowledge of the Law in his minde. And the Kings Prerogative (we know) is bounded with the Rules of Gods Word, and impaled within the limits of the Laws of the Realme.
<hi>For it is the honour and wiſedom of a Prince to judge his people with righteous judgement;</hi> and order his ſteps, actions, and whole courſe of life by the juſtice and equity of law and conſcience. For this is an old, and true rule, <hi>Nemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem oportet eſſe ſapientiorem legibus.</hi> No man <hi>(out of his Own private rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon)</hi> ought to be wiſer than the Law, which is the perfection of reaſon. And albeit the King be (as it hath been ſaid) the Fountain of Juſtice: <hi>Yet this ſpring head may either be overgrown,</hi> and ſhadowed by the weeds of naturall corruption, and inbred infirmities always aſpiring and advancing themſelves againſt the perfect law of liberty, erected in the heart by the holy Spirit. <hi>Rom.</hi>
7.23. <hi>James</hi> 1.25. or it may be ſtopped by the rubbiſh of cares and troubles; or at leaſt the water of this Fountain may run thick ſomtimes by mixture of the gravell of a pre-conceited, high opinion of the affections and hearts of the people: or laſtly, this well, or ſpring-head of Juſtice in the Sovereign may be ſo deep; as that ſquint and blear'd-eye of the monſtrous-ſighted multitude (I mean the groſſe ignorance of the Common people) cannot always diſcern, and diſcover where it lyes; onely thoſe who believing Gods Word, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently relying upon the truth of his promiſes, do in humility of heart come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the true Well of life, and head indeed of the Church Jeſus Chriſt our one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mediator and Redeemer; they onely (I ſay) by the bucket of grace ſhall be able to ſound the depths of Gods mercy towards his Elect, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do they cry: <hi>God be mercifull unto us, and bleſſe us: and cauſe his face to ſhine upon us. Selah. That thy way maybe known upon earth; thy ſaving health among all Nations. Let the people praiſe thee, ô God, let all the people praiſe thee. O let the Nations be glad, and ſing for joy: for thou ſhalt judge the folk righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly; and govern the Nations upon earth. Selah.</hi> Albeit in the ſcorching heat of Seditions, Diviſions, Tumults, Rebellions, and Diſtractions of a Kingdom, thoſe ſtreams of grace and favour that iſſue from (that ſubordinate and inferiour fountain of juſtice) a pious Prince, provident, and carefull of <pb n="19" facs="tcp:117311:16"/> the welfare of his people, are not ſo viſibly and plainly perceived (for in truth they doe not run ſo cleer then as at other times) by the vulgar ſort of men: yet the beſt Chriſtians his Majeſties moſt faithfull and obedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, under the protection of whoſe powerfull Arme they live, and are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, do acknowledge Gods watchfull providence over them: and theſe do joyntly confeſſe, and ſay with the Pſalmiſt. <hi>God ſtandeth in the congregation of the mighty, he judgeth among the Gods. For if the Angels are all miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to minister for them who ſhall be heires of ſalvation; Heb.</hi> 1.14. Much more are the Potentates and Princes of the earth, the ſervants of God to miniſter juſtice unto his people.
<hi>Shall not the Judge of all the world do right? Thy throne (ô God) is for ever, and ever: and the ſcepter of thy Kingdom is a right ſcepter. Righteouſneſs and judgment are the habitation of thy ſeat: and thy mercy and truth ſhall be our ſhield and buckler, Verily there is a reward for the righteous; Doubtleſs there is a God that judgeth the earth. The Lord ſaith, Counſell is mine, and ſound wiſdom: I am underſtanding, I have ſtrength. By me Kings reigne, and Princes decree juſtice. By me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the earth. I love them that Love Me, and thoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me.

20.28. When the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Jeremiah</hi> by a falſe ſuggeſtion was put into the Dungeon of <hi>Malchiah:</hi> (For <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the King ſaid unto his Princes, behold, he is in your hand; for the <hi>King is not he that can do any thing against you</hi>). And when <hi>Ebedme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,</hi> afterwards by ſuite had gotten him ſome enlargment. Then <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the King ſent and took <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet unto him into the third entry, that is in the houſe of the Lord, and the King ſaid to <hi>Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing: hide nothing from me. Then Jeremiah ſaid to</hi> Zedekiah,
<hi>if I declare is unto thee, wilt thou not ſurely put me to death? &amp; if I give thee counſell, wilt thou not harken unto me? So the King ſware ſecretly to</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>ſaying, As the Lord liveth that made this ſoule, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of theſe men that ſeek thy life.

Saint <hi>Peter</hi> knew it could not be, and therefore joyneth faith and knowledge, ſaying; <hi>And we believe and know, that thou art That Chriſt the Son of the living God.</hi> For he yeildeth a reaſon, why he, and other of the Apoſtles believed in Chriſt; namely, becauſe they knew that he was the Son of God. Which being ſo, it neceſſarily follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that they believe not, to whom thoſe things are unknown, that he hath revealed in his Word. And therefore that tale of Popery concerning <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicita fides,</hi> an ignorant faith, is moſt fooliſh: for faith and knowledge are ſo knit together, that they cannot be ſeparated. Truſt perfectly in the grace that is brought unto you in the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to truſt, excludeth doubting. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.13, 14. We know, we know, &amp;c. excluding doubting. <hi>I am perſwaded that neither death, nor life, &amp;c. ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord. Rom.</hi> 8.38. The knowledge which we have by hope grounded upon Gods promiſes, is ſo ſure, that it cannot be deceived: as it is plaine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. The perſwaſion that the Apoſtle hath in other places, is alſo grounded upon good Arguments; but here, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. upon the immutable Decree of God. And it is good reaſon to prove, that every Chriſtian man which is endued with faith and hope, may and ought to be infallibly aſſured, that he is juſtified, and ſhall be ſaved; becauſe the Word of God, and his promiſe to all that believe in him (and in faith call upon him) cannot faile, but be moſt infallibly true. That we ſhall alſo perſevere in the favour of God, and ſo conſequently, that we are predeſtinated to eternall life; the Apoſtle doth moſt plainly prove in this <hi>Chapter:</hi> wherefore by the Spirit of Adoption, and the effects of Gods grace agreeable, we may have certaine knowledge, that we ſhall inherit Gods Kingdome; which none ſhall do, but they that continue unto the end, and were appointed unto it, before the beginning of the world. And this is true humility, when we preſume nothing upon our owne ſtrength, or worthineſſe, but depend wholly upon the truth of Gods promiſes. Moreover marke the Comandement of the Apoſtle to the, <hi>Cor.

The Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. <hi>Thy ſin is done away.</hi> And our Saviour Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Son be of good cheere, thy ſinnes are forgiven thee, Mat.</hi> 9. <hi>And thy faith hath made thee <pb n="31" facs="tcp:117311:22"/> whole, hath, hath, not ſhall, ſhall, it is done, doubt not, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore, we juſtly conclude, out of the ſtable Word of God, That faith is a knowledge firme and certaine. But Popery doth croſſe this plaine truth, That know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ought to go with faith. There is nothing more hatefull in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of darkneſſe, than to heare of knowledge, and in this particular moſt they abide it not: For
<hi>Nic Cuſanus Epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>ad Baron.</hi> a great pillar of their Church is not aſhamed to write, that, <hi>Obedientia irrationalis eſt conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta obedientia &amp; perfectiſſima, quando obeditur ſine inquiſitione rationis, ſicut i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Babington</hi> in his Expoſition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt Article of the Creed, ſaith thus, A moſt ſtrange ſpeech, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a horſe, or

As this Doctrine of <hi>Proving all things</hi> now in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, doth reprove the palpable ignorance, and blinde zeale of the Papiſts; ſo it doth comend the activity and diligence of many of the Laity, as of the Clergy in thoſe laſt times, that have attained unto a great meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods revealed Will, by an induſtrious and frequent reading of the Scriptures, joyned with prayer, and hearing of the Word, not omitting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the learned, and uſing other good means, for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of them.

               <p>Moreover the Papiſts are more blinde in their beliefe; than they are groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly idolatrous, in their worſhip and ſervice of God. It ſhall be worth our time and paines to conſider the worſhipping of Images, whether it be lawfull for a Chriſtian man or woman cringing, kneeling, creeping, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, kiſſing, lighting up candles to it, and ſuch like, as we ſee done in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with great obſervation. In the Scriptures of God we have a plaine Comandement. <hi>Thou ſhalt not make any graven image, &amp;c.</hi> Read the 4.5.6. and 7
<hi>Chapters</hi> of <hi>Deut. Neither ſhalt thou ſet thee up any graven image, which the Lord thy God hateth,</hi> Deut. 16. <hi>Curſed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an abomination unto the Lord, the workes of the hands of the craftſman, and putteth it in a ſecret place,</hi> Deut. 27. See Exod. 23.24. Levit. 26.30. and Iſai. 41.29. and
44.10. and Jer. 43.13. and Pſalm. 97.</p>
               <p>Let it fall then even in the feare of God, what mans head inventeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord in his own duty; and at the laſt, let us ſee it to be a vain mocks to think we can worſhip God in an Image, and by it, or under it. Our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries have a ſhift for defence of Images in the Church; but it is a very ill favoured one. They are (ſay they) Lay-mens books, and ſtand in very good <pb n="33" facs="tcp:117311:23"/> ſtead to put us in mind of God. Now that they are no good Books, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous and deceiving ſights, for lay-men, or other whatſoever, let the Word of the Lord himſelf be Judge. The Prophet <hi>Jeremie</hi> in Zeal of Spirit deteſteth ſuch books, and refuſeth to be put in minde of God, by any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull means. <hi>For the Stock</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a doctrine of vanity, yea, they are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the work of errours, and in the time of their viſitation, they ſhall periſh Jer.</hi> 10. The Prophet
<hi>Habakuk</hi> againe ſaith, <hi>That the image is a teacher of lies, though he that made it, truſt in it, &amp;c. Habak</hi> 2.18. Shall then the Book full of lies, vanities and errour, be ſo good a book and remembrance to Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? Shall that which endangereth the learned, nothing hurt, think we, the unlearned? O, that we knew not by experience, into what fond and wicked opinions of God, poore people have been brought by theſe painted and carved books? How many hearts lament their folly, and how many tongues to the praiſe of Gods mercy in viſiting them with his light, can and do tell, what fond conceits they had of the Lord, and heavenly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſeduced by the ſight of their eyes? Therefore ſince God hath ſaid it, and experience found it, that they are ſo dangerous, let them be books for <hi>Pagans</hi> and
<hi>Heathens:</hi> Surely for Chriſtians they ſhould not be. Which of the Prophets or Apoſtles went about ever to have Images made, either to put themſelves in minde of any thing which the Lord had taught them, or the people of any thing w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they delivered to them from the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

The Lord himſelf ſaith, <hi>Ye ſaw no Image, but heard a voice only: therfore make no Image.</hi> And again, <hi>You ſaw that I ſpake to you from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, therfore you ſhall make no Gods of gold, nor ſilver, Deut.</hi> 4. As if he ſhould have ſaid, my practiſe in ſpeaking to you by voice, &amp; not by image, ſhould teach you, that by my Word, and not by Image; I am to be remembred. And it is a notable place in
<hi>Eſay, That when the Word ſhall take place with his, then they ſhall abhor images. Iſai.</hi> 30.21. Now hereupon it followeth, that we ought to ſerve the Lord, according to that Rule, which himſelfe hath laid down, and preſcribed only. <hi>You ſhall not do every man what ſeemeth good in his own eyes, for in vaine do men worſhip me with traditions of men, ſaith the Lord. Deut.</hi> 12. <hi>Moſes</hi> did nothing in building the materiall Tabernacle, beſide that was comanded, and ſhewed him, <hi>Nadab</hi> and
<hi>Abihu,</hi> the ſons of <hi>Aaron</hi> died, for preſuming of themſelves to ſerve the Lord, with ſtrange fire, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. The very heatheniſh <hi>Romanes</hi> had this reaſon with them, that it was better for them to be quite without Chriſt, than to worſhip him, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:117311:24"/> others with him againſt his will and liking. And, <hi>ad placandum Deum in opus habent homines quae ille jubet,</hi> that is, To pleaſe the Lord (ſaith <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>) men have need of thoſe things, that he himſelfe comandeth. And a Chriſtian minde doth not finde a ſure ſtay, but when it heareth, <hi>Hoc dicit Dominus, Thus ſaith the Lord If Saul breake the courſe that God doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, and of himſelfe deviſe to ſerve the Lord, be his neceſſity to do ſo,</hi> as he thinketh, never ſo great, and the intent of his heart never ſo holy-like, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, <hi>Samuel</hi> both muſt, and will <hi>tell him to his face he hath done fooliſhly;</hi> for the Lord hath more pleaſure in that his will is obeyed, than in all the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> offered up unto him of our own wills and heads, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. and 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.
<hi>Intents will not ſerve;</hi> neither voluntary religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtand accepted. And therefore let us even weigh and follow the counſell of
<hi>Solomon, and look to our feet when we enter into the houſe of God, being more ready to heare, then to offer the ſacrifice of fooles, Eccleſ.</hi> 4. Read <hi>Babington</hi> upon the ſecond Comandement. Thus we ſee that Popiſh Religion is grounded upon unwritten Traditions. But no man is to follow or admit a Religion, whoſe grounds are either contrary to Scriptures, or to themſelves, or are new and uncertain, or elſe depend on the credit of man, as moſt of their Traditions do. Whoſoever therefore either regardeth the Laws of God, or abhorreth falſhood and hereſie, cannot chooſe but abhor all the abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Maſſing Religion, and never ſuffer any ſuch thing within the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> if he can hinder it: Thoſe Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that together with the Law of God retained Groves, and hill Altars, and other Reliques of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, never proſpered. The mingled Religion of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> to the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> was moſt odious. <hi>Emanuel Commenus</hi> that linked himſelf with the

<hi>Turkiſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, became afterward in all his action, moſt unhappy, and after his death moſt infamous. <hi>If we may have no good Conditions in Spaine and Italy,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> may do well, to forbear to ſpeak of <hi>England,</hi> where Chriſtians are better reſolved of their Religion, than <hi>Papiſts</hi> can be of their new Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, eſpecially conſidering the diverſity of our grounds. And albeit <hi>France doth threaten their Proteſtants, with like meaſure,</hi> as is meted unto <hi>Papists</hi> here in <hi>England:</hi> yet we believe, and know that the ſame God which deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered our Nation from the bondage &amp; ſlavery, and the <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſſe of Popery; The Lord which doth continue his mercy unto us, and the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and light of the Goſpell unto this day amongſt us, is both able to preſerve thoſe that are godly, and he will deliver his people out of the jaws of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when, and whereſoever they do call upon him in truth.

Why ſuch a one as I, ſo obſcure to the eye of the world, and ſo mean in many reſpects, would adventure, or dare once to peepe forth among the preſs of Wits, that juſtle abroad by whole Troops and Bands, like ſo many Armed Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers fit for <hi>Rencontre,</hi> in this underſtanding, eagle-ey'd, literate, knowing age? To this I anſwer, Firſt, albeit, I am of green years, and 'tis true, I am of a weak and raw judgement, of ſmall experience, learning and ability, yet it is now almoſt thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years ſince I was admitted a Scholar into the Univerſity at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where I continued ſix years and upwards, and ſithence, I have been reſident for the moſt part in <hi>London,</hi> and a Student in the <hi>Municipall</hi> or Common Laws of the Realm, and ſome knowledge I have gained in Travell. Secondly, I have met with great oppoſitions and contradictions of the Religion which I profeſſe, by Papiſts, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians ſelfe-knowing, conceited men, and others popiſhly affected in the Society wherein I live, and in other places where I have been converſant. And herein I would gladly quit my ſelfe of the prejudice and miſpriſions of mine Adverſaries by proteſting againſt them and their Tenets. And thirdly, only for holding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Doctrine of the Reformed Proteſtant Religion, as it is expreſſed in the 39 Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and agreeable to Gods Word, and for my obedience thereunto: and likewiſe for maintaining the honour, the Wiſdome and Juſtice of the proceedings of the High-Court of Parliament, againſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and force of Ignorance and blinde Zeal, againſt the raſh opinions of unſetled vain-heads, and againſt the intoxicating poyſonous breath of malevolent Tongues: <pb facs="tcp:117311:25"/> This, I had for my paines; I was counted and eſteemed of, as a Time-ſerver, a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan, a Browniſt, an

But the chief reaſon indeed, that moved me to write this my Proteſtation, was the faithfull and true diſcharge of my conſcience. For where <hi>God hath given a minde, a will, (and in ſome meaſure) abilities; there ought not to be an unprofitable doing nothing: But the Talents of Grace, according to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours precept, are to be well imployed; that, when we are called to give an account of our Stewardſhips, our Master Chriſt Jeſus, may receive from us his ſervants the glory and praiſe of his own grace.</hi> And ſince I might not, and in truth, it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly, that I ſhould bring a rough, and unpoliſhed Talent to the <hi>Common Gazo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philacy,</hi> or <hi>Treaſury of Religion,</hi> I deem it meet <hi>to caſt this Mite into my Spirituall mothers lap, the Church of England.</hi> And though I am no <hi>Pilot</hi> to guide, or <hi>to ſteer the courſe of our Church,</hi> which (like a ſhip toſſed, and blown to and fro with ſtorms and tempeſts) is floating in a
